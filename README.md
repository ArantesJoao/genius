# Genius

Welcome to Genius, my AI SaaS project designed to showcase my skills and the potential of modern web and AI technologies. I've built this application using a robust stack including Clerk, Shadcn, Stripe, React, Next.js, OpenAI, and Replicate.

## Live Demo

Experience Genius firsthand by visiting [Genius](https://genius-joo-vctor-arantes-projects.vercel.app/). Here, you can create an account, explore the functionalities, or even sign up for the Pro plan.

### Account Creation and Pro Plan

Feel free to register a new account (I am using Clerk in the authentication process) to personalize your experience. If you're interested in additional features, signing up for the Pro plan is a great way to see everything Genius can offer.

### Testing Payments

The Stripe payment gateway is in test mode, so you can safely enter payment details without any real transactions occurring. Use the default Stripe example card for testing:

- **Card Number:** 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Expiration Date:** 05/55
- **CVV:** 555
- **Name:** [Any name]

This project was developed as part of a guided coding experience with [Code With Antonio](https://www.codewithantonio.com/projects/ai-saas), enhancing my learning and application of these technologies.
